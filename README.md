# BikeSharing
Work with data visualization software - Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company.

## Overview
This project consisted of delivering data analysis for a bike sharing business proposal for angel investors looking to seed fund the endeavor.  The primary goal was to analyze citibike data from New York City, specifically the month of August.  This analysis intended to visualize business operates in its prime summer season.  Initially the data was reformatted and scrubbed before my analysis created visualizations to display the trends and opportunities it would have in our desired city.

## Cleaning the Data
Jupyter Notebook was used to reformat the trip duration data to a datetime field.

## Results
The data analysis was for NYC, the results were interesting, especially around geographical areas of interest.  Some trips were outliers, while other followed along the river. Attractions related to geographical areas for new cities is important to consider for bike availability.  Its hard to capture lost rentals due to availability but prioritizing busy landmarks is important.

## Checkout Times
Check out times for users is important as well, some landmarks or areas of interest best for certain times of the day.  Analysis for this is visualized below.

## Checkout Times by Gender
Further analysis shows how males are more inclined to commute via bikeshare, capitalizing this and compelling more of the female demographic with advertising would potentially boost sharing in the community.

## Mapping
The visualizations from Tableau are powerful to communicate the data from NYC and how it can relate to a new city.  The mapping visualization is very compelling to strategize where to concentrate a initial campaign.  A intial map with popular landmarks would be a great starting point.

## Summary

To further analyze the bike share business for our seed donors, we created more visualization observing trips by weekday for each hour. Then took it a step further and split it by gender.

Two final thoughts would be to promote bike share like parking validation.  If a bike is used to commute to a job or place of business a discount could be applied to the trip after validation, even potentially make the ride free on the right terms.  Last the host city making streets bike friendly would be a huge benefit and something to pursue for long term success.
